## About (pullprompt)

**pullprompt** GitHub Action allow you to comment on a Pull Request with a message with in generated by user given prompt. Under the hood, it user Google's Gemini API to generate the text.

## Usage

The Action takes three inputs:

1. `github-token` - Required. The GitHub token to use for authentication.
2. `user-prompt` - Optional. The prompt to generate the text. Default is "Share an open-source tip in 2 to 3 lines to help developers improve their workflow". You will find that in the `action.yml` file.
3. `gemini-api-key` - Required. The Gemini API key to use for authentication an to interact with the API to generate the text. You can do that by visiting the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) page. Once you have the API key, you can add it to your repository secrets. You can do that by going to the repository settings and then to the secrets tab. Add a new secret with the name `GEMINI_API_KEY` and the value as the API key.

The nature of action is to only work on pull requests. It will not work on any other event. 

```yaml
on:
  pull_request: # woks only on pull request
```

Here is an example workflow that uses pullprompt:

```yaml
name: pullprompt

on:
  pull_request: # woks only on pull request

jobs:
  pull_prompt:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: read # Required for reading the files
      pull-requests: write # Required for commenting on PR

    steps:
      - name: Checkout the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Running pullprompt
        uses: Pradumnasaraf/pullprompt@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Required
          user-prompt: "Write your prompt here" # Optional
          gemini-api-key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }} # Required
```
